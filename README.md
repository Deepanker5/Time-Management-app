# Time-Management-app
# Introduction
This is a time management app that I built using python and the PyQt5 library for the GUI and it utilises json files when storing the information on how much time has been spent on each subject

# File and directory structure
The final project files are "time_management.py", "Subject.py" and "time_spent_object.py"

# Installation Instructions
The files to be downloaded for the final project files are "check_boxes.py", "subject_object.py" and "time_spent_object.py"
The libraries to be installed are the following: pyqt5, and json.

# User Instructions
Run the program and when you want to add a subject, do it in the following manner "subject name, hours required" and press the OK button.
In order to access the previous data file, run the stop_watch and then press the "reset" button then press the "show day's progress" button, then the program should open a file which shows the time spent during the day.
